\usage{
bibarplotsDiversityCond(DF1, DF2, threshold1 = 0, threshold2 = 1,
  label1 = "Proteomics (detected)",
  label2 = paste("Transcriptomics (â‰¥ ", threshold2, "FPKM)"),
  sorted = TRUE, common = TRUE, colorpal = NULL, publish = TRUE,
  output = "count", verbose = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{DF1}{numeric data.frame (first study expression data)}

\item{DF2}{numeric data.frame (second study expression data)}

\item{threshold1}{numeric. Expression above which a gene is considered as expressed for the first study}

\item{threshold2}{numeric. Expression above which a gene is considered as expressed for the second study}

\item{label1}{character string. Label for the first study to use on the plot}

\item{label2}{character string. Label for the second study to use on the plot}

\item{sorted}{boolean. Default: TRUE. Whether the tissues should be sorted in function of their number of tissue specific genes}

\item{common}{boolean. Default: TRUE. Whether the two studies should share identical rownames and colnames}

\item{colorpal}{colour palette to use in the figure (done with ggplot2::scale_fill_manual)}

\item{publish}{boolean. Default: TRUE. Whether to apply ggplot2::theme_bw to the plot.}

\item{output}{character string. Switch that allows to choose between 'count' for the count of unique genes across the tissues
or a ratio based on the distribution of the tissue specific genes across each study.}

\item{verbose}{boolean. Default: TRUE.}

\item{...}{other arguments that can be used by ggplot2::theme_bw()}
}
